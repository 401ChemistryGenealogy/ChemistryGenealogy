* Initialized the backend with rails-api
* Followed most of #17 on https://github.com/mefeghhi/poll-api
* Haven't been able to do #18 yet
* Created a User model and controller
* Created a temporary model and controller for Contact Us (when receiving information for a concern)
* Honestly, haven't been able to do anything too solid for both
